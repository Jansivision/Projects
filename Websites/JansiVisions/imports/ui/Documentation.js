	          This will comprise of the following;</p>
						<h3>Online market: </h3><p id="in">This is where buyers and sellers will be able to interact. What makes this different from all other platform is because we are going to provide security measures for both buyers and sellers. Sellers will be required to submit a product for inspection to our offices before it could be posted on the web. The seller has to sign a contract with us assuring that their product is free from complications and is fit for sell. The buyer on the other hand will be given a contract of assurance from us that the product is free from complications and a 100% refund will be given in case otherwise. This market will include both Goods and Services.</p>
						<h3>Investment Platform: </h3><p id="in">The whole purpose of this platform is to provide investors an opportunity to invest in upcoming companies not listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LSE). Apart from that it will allow locals to invest in small businesses to help them grow financially and provide a pool of investors for people looking for financers hence, helping people develop their ideas into real life businesses.</p>
						<h3>Financial Pillar: </h3><p id="in">This will help in various financial assistance such as, Rent assistance, Purchase contract, Education assistance, Farming assistance, Building assistance, Tourism planning.</p>
